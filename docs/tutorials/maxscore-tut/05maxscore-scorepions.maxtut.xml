<p>Scorepions to be included in the Scorepion menu need to reside in "MaxScore Lib/Scorepions". This Scorepion is based on "Fill Empty Measures with Rest" and serves as an annotated template.</p>

<h4 class="mkd-blockquote-text"><span>A Scorepion uses the grab object to receive info queries from the host. When the MaxScore Editor receives a message starting with sendScorepion from a Max patch it's embedded in all of its attributes are sent to the currently loaded Scorepion, e.g. "sendScorepion bang". 
Send all messages to the MaxScore Editor via the outlet.</span></h4>
