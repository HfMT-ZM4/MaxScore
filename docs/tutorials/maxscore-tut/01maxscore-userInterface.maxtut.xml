<h1>MaxScore Editor: The User Interface</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The MaxScore Editor is a GUI designed for editing MaxScore scores directly in a Max patcher window. The backbone of the Editor is the <o>MaxScore</o> mxj object which implements the Java Music Specification Language in Max.
</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>In this tutorial, we will get familiar with the GUI of the MaxScore Editor and introduce its basic functions.</p>

<p>Access <o>Maxscore.Editor</o> by right-clicking on an empty space of a Max patch window, then selecting “Paste From>MaxScore>Editors>maxscore.editor.clipping.maxpat”. You are now ready to start working on a new project.</p>
<p>Lock the patcher and open the Editor window by clicking on the “Open Editor” button inside the <o>bpatcher</o>.

<h2>Hello World</h2>

  <li>Let's add the first note. In order to add notes, double click or ctrl-click on a blank space on the designated measure. The note is blue now which means it is selected. If you want to transpose notes, you can either cmd-drag (Mac) or ctrl-drag (Windows), or use the keyboard shortcuts u, j, i, k, o, l for respective transpositions. You can always access the list of shortcuts from the menu: "Edit>Shortcuts".

  <li>To convert a note into a rest, click the rest button on top of the third column in the Tools panel, or alternatively use the keyboard shortcut r.</li>
  <li>To add dynamics or articulation, select a note and then choose from the Tools bar the corresponding symbols. e.g. for dynamics check the 5th column.</li>
  <li>If you wish to add a crescendo or decrescendo to your score, drag-enclose the notes to which you want this to apply and click the respective symbols from the Tools pane.</li>
  <li>If you want to turn your notes into tuplets, select the notes and then choose the corresponding symbols from the Tools pane (5th and 6th columns, ‘3’, ‘5’, ‘7’, ‘9’, etc.)</li>
  <li>To add repeats or barlines, select the measure and then click on the corresponding symbols at the bottom of the Tools pane.</li>
</ul>
