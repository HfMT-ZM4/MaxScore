<h1>Welcome to MaxScore!</h1>

<p>MaxScore provides a barrage of different possibilities for musicians, composers, creators, programmers and not only. It offers maximum flexibility for music notation, as it gives the opportunity to create a score and interfere with it in multiple groundbreaking and creative ways. The advantage of using MaxScore in comparison to other professional notation environments is its integration into the Max environment, allowing programmers to adapt the application to their needs. MaxScore is a leading application for graphical and microtonal notation. It gives the opportunity to integrate graphics and it is designed to represent pitch with visually unlimited precision. Furthermore, the API part of MaxScore is capable of rendering different environments and interacting with 3d objects. It is the perfect tool to combine music notation with VR/AR environments. Another feature that makes MaxScore unique is its capability to export a score to different popular formats for professional publishing.</p>
