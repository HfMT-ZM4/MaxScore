<h1>How to install MaxScore</h1>

<h2><b>1. Start</b></h2>

<p>To uninstall a previously version of MaxScore run the Uninstaller which you'll find in Max 8/Uninstallers/MaxScore. MaxScore requires Max 8.1.8 and higher.</p>

<p>Important info for Max 8 users upgrading from Max 7: If your old MaxScore package was automatically copied to the Max 8 packages folder, please remove it before installing a recent version of MaxScore.</p>
<p><i>After downloading the installer, open the file. You will first see a splash screen with the MaxScore logo and a text window informing you about the steps youâ€™re about to take.</i></p>

<p><i>Click OK and click the Next button in the installer window underneath.</i></p>

<p><i>Accept the license agreement and click on Next.</i></p>

<p>On the next window, click on the folder icon and navigate to the location of Max folder you want to install MaxScore into. </p>
<p>Max 8 and Live 10 and higher:</p>
<p>The best choice for your MaxScore installation is /Users/[your_home_folder]/Documents/Max 8/ (macOS) or C:Users[your_user_name]DocumentsMax 8 (Windows).</p>

<p><b>Refer to the Max documentation if you choose to install MaxScore into another Max 8 folder besides the one indicated above. DO NOT create your own Max 8 folders as Max or Live may not be able to find the files if those folders have not originally been created by Max itself.</b></p>

<p>After clicking Next, decide on the type of installation (Minimal = MaxScore for Max only; Full = MaxScore and LiveScore for Ableton Live).</p>
