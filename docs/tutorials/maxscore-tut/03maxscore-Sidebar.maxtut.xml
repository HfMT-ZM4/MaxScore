<h1>MaxScore: Sidebar</h1>

<p>While selecting the score view, on the right sidebar you can see 4 main sections:</p>
<techdetail>
<ol>
<li>Tools</li>
<li> Pitch Utility </li>
<li> Scorepions </li>
<li> Picster </li>

<p>Each of these corresponds to specific features that you can use when creating your score.</p>

<p>Under <link type="tutorial" module="maxscore" name="03maxscore-Tools">Tools</link> you can customize the note durations or pauses, dynamics, hide or modify note heads, tune grouping, add articulation, as well as key selection, key size, key signature, measure width, and various barlines you can use when you type.
