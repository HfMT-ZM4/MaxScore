<h1>Playback</h1>

<p>MaxScore/LiveScore Sampler and MaxScore/LiveScore Fluidsynth are two playback patches/devices that were especially designed for the MaxScore/LiveScore Editor and its microtonal capabilities. So far, the combination of Editor and Sampler and/or Fluidsynth is the only way to consistently compose and playback microtonal music in Ableton Live and, therefore, rely on a communication protocol different from MIDI.</p>
