<h1>Playback in MaxScore</h1>

<h2>maxscore.makenote</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned before, MaxScore is an environment designed for the notation and playback of microtones. We are therefore using a MIDI-like protocol which indicates pitch in MIDI cents.</p>
<p>The maxscore.makenote abstraction is used to convert the output of the MaxScore abstraction into the format understood by the MaxScore playback devices:</p>

<techdetail>
Note on: note 6000 78 1<br/>
Note off: note 6000 0 1
</techdetail>

<p>The three numbers denote pitch (in MIDI cents), velocity and channel.</p>
<p>The maxscore.makenote object also receives a dictionary containing the Picster expressions attached to notes and intervals. These expressions will be looked up during playback and sent out to the parent patcher via the second outlet.</p>

<h2>Playback Devices</h2>
Currently three playback devices are available for sound generation

<p>MaxScore/LiveScore Sampler and MaxScore/LiveScore Fluidsynth2 are two playback patches/devices that were especially designed for the MaxScore/LiveScore Editor and its microtonal capabilities. So far, the combination of Editor and Sampler and/or Fluidsynth is the only way to consistently compose and playback microtonal music in Ableton Live.</p>

<h3>Fluidsynth und Sound Fonts</h3>

<p><br/> </p>
<techdetail>
<p><b>The Fluidsynth2 player is capable of using an abundance of sound fonts available on the Net.</b></p></techdetail>
<p>In our tutorial patch you will see a score by the American composer Easley Blackwood in 23-tone equal temperament. Turn on audio and press the start button to begin playback. You can also experiment with setLoopingPlayback and setSection messages. To play a section use playSection message instead of start. Turn Overdrive on when you notice that playback is not even.</p>

<h3>Sampler and Sample Banks</h3>

<p>The Sampler uses a propriety text-based format with an built-in editor. There will be a separate tutorial on how to use the sampler and its GUI.</p>

<techdetail>
<p>For your convenience, open the Combo template from Max File menu>New>From Template>MaxScore>Combo. It contains the Editor as well as two playback devices.</p>

<h3>conTimbre Support</h3>
<p>The maxscore.2conTimbre interfaces with the conTimbre ePlayer and also opens its preset files. Go to <a href="https://www.contimbre.com/en">conTimbre</a> for more information on this sound library.</p>
