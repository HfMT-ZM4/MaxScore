You can either download the complete installer (including the JDK) from http://computermusicnotation.com or clone this GitHub repository to Max 8/packages/. Additional resources for Ableton Live can be found here: https://github.com/HfMT-ZM4/LiveScore. Clone this repo into your Ableton Live User Library. First delete any previous MaxScore installations in your Max 8/Packages folder(s).
