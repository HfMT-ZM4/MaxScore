# MaxScore Installation

You can either download the complete installer from http://computermusicnotation.com or clone this GitHub repository to Max 8/packages/. In the latter case, you'd also need to clone the microUtilities which you can find here: https://github.com/HfMT-ZM4/microUtilities. Additional resources for Ableton Live can be found here: https://github.com/HfMT-ZM4/LiveScore. Clone this repo into your Ableton Live User Library. First delete any previous MaxScore installations in your Max 8/Packages folder(s). MaxScore also requires the Java JDK to be installed.
Tutorials and guides on MaxScore can be found in the Max Reference (look for it in the Help menu). In the Max Reference, go to Home and scroll down to the Contents section.
